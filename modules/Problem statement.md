# Industry-specific unemployment impact â€” problem statement

## Executive summary

This project analyzes how unemployment rates vary by industry, occupation, education level and demographic groups in Singapore. The goal is to identify which sectors and roles are most vulnerable to job losses (automation, economic shocks, structural change) and to derive evidence-based recommendations for reskilling and policy.

## Main research question

How have different industries and occupations contributed to changes in the unemployment rate in Singapore?

## Objectives

- Identify industries/occupations with consistently high or rising unemployment.
- Measure how education level, gender and occupation skill level affect unemployment.
- Detect resilient industries (stable or falling unemployment) and vulnerable ones.
- Produce predictive and prescriptive outputs (risk ranking, projected trends, recommended reskilling targets).

## Supporting questions

- Trend analysis: Which industries or occupations show persistently high unemployment? How have rates changed over time?
- Education & occupation dynamics: How does education level affect unemployment within occupations? Have gaps widened or narrowed?
- Comparative insights: How do high-skill occupations compare to lower-skill occupations? Are technical skill industries more insulated?
- Role of technology: Are occupations exposed to automation/AI experiencing larger unemployment increases?

## Hypothesis

Lower-skilled occupations (service, sales, clerical, manual labor) have higher and more volatile unemployment rates than higher-skilled occupations (managers, professionals).

> Why it matters: confirmation supports targeted upskilling/reskilling programs and helps prioritize sectors for workforce development.

## Data required (suggested schema)

- year (int)
- quarter (optional)
- industry_code / industry_name
- occupation_code / occupation_name
- education_level (e.g., none, secondary, diploma, degree)
- gender
- age_group
- unemployed_count (int)
- labor_force_count (int)
- unemployment_rate (float)  # unemployed_count / labor_force_count
- avg_wage (optional)
- automation_risk_score (optional)  # external mapping per occupation

If you have household survey or administrative microdata, include identifiers and sampling weights where applicable.

## Suggested analysis plan

1. Data cleaning & validation: missingness, consistent industry/occupation mappings, compute unemployment_rate from counts.
2. Descriptive analysis: time-series plots by industry and occupation; heatmaps of unemployment rates.
3. Stratified analysis: compare rates by education level, gender and age groups within occupations.
4. Resilience / volatility metrics: compute variability (std, CV) and trend slopes per industry/occupation.
5. Predictive model (optional): forecast unemployment rates using time-series or regression models; or build a classifier that flags occupations at high risk.
6. Prescriptive output: rank occupations by risk and map to potential reskilling targets (identify growing industries and overlapping skill sets).

## Possible metrics & evaluation

- Mean and median unemployment rate by group
- Trend slope (change per year)
- Volatility (standard deviation / coefficient of variation)
- Prediction accuracy (RMSE for continuous forecasts; precision/recall for binary high-risk classification)
