    "# Module 4 : Singapore Occupational Unemployment Prediction 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides data-driven forecasts of Singapore's occupation-specific unemployment rates for 2025, with particular focus on identifying high-risk occupations to inform workforce planning and policy interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predictive Models Performance**:\n",
    "   - KNN regression model achieved 9.81% MAPE and 0.34 MAE for point forecasts\n",
    "   - Logistic regression achieved 75% accuracy for predicting unemployment rise probability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-Risk Occupations for 2025**:\n",
    "   - Craftsmen and Related Trades Workers (85% risk of unemployment increase)\n",
    "   - Professionals (77% risk)\n",
    "   - Cleaners, Labourers and Related Workers (71% risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unemployment Rate Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Targeted forecasts for all major occupation categories\n",
    "   - Context-aware predictions accounting for historical trends\n",
    "   - Integrated demographic and qualification indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis provides critical insights for Singapore's labor market stakeholders:\n",
    "- **Government Agencies**: Data-driven evidence for targeted intervention programs\n",
    "- **Industry Associations**: Early warning signals for sector-specific workforce challenges\n",
    "- **Education Institutions**: Guidance for developing relevant training programs\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Singapore's labor market continues to undergo significant transformation driven by technological advancement, economic restructuring, and post-pandemic recovery dynamics. Understanding and predicting occupation-specific unemployment trends has become critical for workforce development planning, policy formulation, and economic resilience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis leverages historical labor market data from the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), combined with demographic indicators and qualification metrics, to develop predictive models for occupation-level unemployment in Singapore. The focus is on providing actionable intelligence for stakeholders responsible for Singapore's workforce development and economic planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This module aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Forecast 2025 unemployment rates** for key occupation categories using machine learning models\n",
    "2. **Identify occupations at high risk** of unemployment increases to prioritize intervention efforts\n",
    "3. **Quantify uncertainty and confidence levels** in predictions to support risk-aware decision making\n",
    "4. **Provide actionable recommendations** for workforce development initiatives based on data-driven insights\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analytical approach combines time-series forecasting techniques with classification models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **KNN Regression Model**: Predicts specific unemployment rate values by occupation for 2025\n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression Model**: Estimates probability of unemployment increase for each occupation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models incorporate historical unemployment trends, demographic shifts, and economic indicators through a robust feature engineering process. Cross-validation ensures reliability through time-aware validation approaches that respect the temporal nature of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis integrates multiple data sources:\n",
    "- **Labor Force Singapore datasets** (2014-2024): Primary source for occupation-specific unemployment rates\n",
    "- **Resident Unemployment by Qualification**: Contextual data on education-employment relationships\n",
    "- **Age and Gender Distribution**: Demographic indicators as predictive features\n",
    "- **PMET vs Non-PMET Distribution**: Occupation classification metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: All data has been sourced from Singapore's Ministry of Manpower statistical releases, with appropriate preprocessing to ensure consistency and quality.*"

    "    - Extract occupation names from column headers\n",

    "    - Create binary classification target (will unemployment rate increase next year?)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "    - Include current unemployment rate as primary predictor\n",

    "# K-Nearest Neighbors Model for Unemployment Rate Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is KNN and why use it for unemployment prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, instance-based learning algorithm that predicts values based on the average of its k nearest neighbors. For our unemployment rate forecasting task, KNN is particularly suitable because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intuitive approach**: It captures similar historical patterns by finding year-occupation combinations with similar feature profiles\n",
    "2. **No distributional assumptions**: Unlike parametric models, KNN doesn't assume any functional relationship between features and target\n",
    "3. **Handles non-linear patterns**: Can capture complex relationships in unemployment data without explicit specification\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Our KNN model uses these carefully selected features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Current unemployment rate**: The most recent rate for each occupation (strongest predictor)\n",
    "- **Lagged unemployment rate**: Previous year's unemployment rate (captures momentum)\n",
    "- **Demographic indicators**: Age groups, gender distribution, qualification levels\n",
    "- **Economic context variables**: PMET status distributions, total unemployment\n",
    "- **Occupation-specific metrics**: From various long-format tables in our database\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection prioritizes variables with strong temporal signals while avoiding leakage from future data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-series splitting**: Using TimeSeriesSplit ensures we validate on future periods, simulating real forecasting\n",
    "2. **Missing value imputation**: Median imputation for numeric features\n",
    "3. **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler applied to normalize all features to the same scale\n",
    "4. **One-hot encoding**: For categorical occupation features\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Tuning and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses GridSearchCV to optimize:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of neighbors (k)**: Testing values 3-11 to find optimal neighborhood size\n",
    "- **Weighting scheme**: Uniform vs. distance-based weights\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation uses MAE and MAPE metrics, with our target being MAPE < 10% for reliable forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application to 2025 Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The final trained model uses features from 2024 data to generate predictions for each occupation's 2025 unemployment rate. These forecasts provide critical early warning for occupations likely to experience rising unemployment."

    "# Logistic Regression for Unemployment Risk Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview: Binary Classification for Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression serves as our second modeling approach, predicting the **probability of unemployment rate increase** for each occupation in 2025. Unlike the KNN model that forecasts exact unemployment rates, this logistic model answers a binary question: \"Will this occupation's unemployment rate rise next year?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Features and Selection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature selection process balances predictive power with interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Current unemployment rate**: Captures the current state of each occupation\n",
    "2. **Lagged unemployment rate**: Includes historical momentum\n",
    "3. **Demographic indicators**: Age groups, gender distribution, education levels\n",
    "4. **Economic context variables**: PMET status distributions, qualification metrics\n",
    "5. **Occupation-specific trends**: Historical patterns from our occupation datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection uses domain knowledge about labor market dynamics while avoiding excessive complexity that could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology and Technical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our logistic regression implementation includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time-series aware validation**: Using TimeSeriesSplit to properly evaluate forward-looking predictions\n",
    "2. **Nested cross-validation**: Provides unbiased performance estimates while tuning hyperparameters\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter optimization**: Grid search across regularization strengths (C), penalty types (L2/elasticnet), and class weights\n",
    "4. **Calibrated probabilities**: Ensuring risk scores represent true likelihood of unemployment increase\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application to Decision Support\n",
    "\n",
    "The output risk scores (0-1) represent the probability of unemployment increase for each occupation, enabling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Early intervention for high-risk occupations\n",
    "- Resource allocation for workforce development programs\n",
    "- Strategic planning for economic agencies\n",
    "- Prioritization of occupations for policy attention\n",
    "\n",
    "This risk-based approach complements the KNN's point forecasts by focusing specifically on identifying occupations most likely to experience deteriorating labor market conditions."

    "## Logistic Regression Model Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model implemented above predicts the probability of unemployment rate increases for different occupations in Singapore for 2025. This binary classification approach complements the KNN regression by focusing specifically on risk assessment rather than exact rate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Performance\n",
    "- **ROC AUC Score**: 0.73\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: 75%\n",
    "- **Precision**: 67%\n",
    "- **Recall**: 67%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: L2-regularized logistic regression with optimized hyperparameters\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**: Nested time-series cross-validation to maintain temporal dependencies\n",
    "- **Feature scaling**: StandardScaler applied to normalize numeric predictors\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning**: GridSearchCV across regularization strengths and penalty types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "The model leverages multiple feature categories to detect patterns in unemployment trends:\n",
    "- Current unemployment rates by occupation\n",
    "- One-year lagged unemployment rates (capturing momentum)\n",
    "- Demographic indicators (age groups, gender distribution)\n",
    "- Education and qualification metrics\n",
    "- PMET status distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results Interpretation\n",
    "The model shows good discriminative ability (ROC AUC 0.73) with balanced precision and recall (both 67%), indicating it correctly identifies two-thirds of occupations at risk of unemployment increases. The 75% accuracy demonstrates the model is substantially better than random guessing, providing actionable intelligence for workforce planning and intervention prioritization. The calibrated probabilities provide a ranking of occupations by risk level, with Craftsmen and Related Trades Workers, Professionals, and Cleaners/Laborers showing the highest probability of unemployment increases in 2025."

    "  - Achieved ROC AUC of 0.73 with balanced accuracy (75%), precision (67%) and recall (67%)\n",
    "  - Effectively identified occupations at risk of unemployment increases\n",
    "  - Best hyperparameters included elasticnet regularization with balanced class weights - Focused on predicting probability of unemployment rate increases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicted Unemployment Rates (2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our KNN Regression model predicts the following unemployment rates by occupation for 2025:\n",
    "- **Clerical Support Workers**: 4.24%\n",
    "- **Service and Sales Workers**: 2.87%\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Practical actions**:\n",
    "  - Develop targeted upskilling programs for the highest-risk occupations\n",
    "  - Monitor structural changes in high-risk sectors\n",
    "  - Create early warning system based on quarterly data refreshes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Policy implications**: Results suggest potential labor market restructuring in trades and professional sectors that may require proactive policy responses.\n"

    "## Model and Data Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the robust methodology applied in this analysis, several limitations should be acknowledged:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time Series Length**:\n",
    "   - The 11-year period (2014-2024) provides limited historical cycles for pattern identification\n",
    "   - Economic shocks like COVID-19 create pattern disruptions that challenge prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Granularity**:\n",
    "   - Occupation categories are broad and may mask significant intra-category variations\n",
    "   - Industry-specific indicators are limited in the current feature set\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **External Factors**:\n",
    "   - Government policy interventions may rapidly change projected trajectories\n",
    "   - Global economic events can create unpredicted shifts in employment patterns\n",
    "   - Technological disruption varies by sector in ways difficult to capture in historical data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Methodological Constraints**:\n",
    "   - KNN model assumes similar historical patterns will recur\n",
    "   - Logistic regression may oversimplify complex relationships\n",
    "   - Limited sample size constrains hyperparameter optimization\n",
