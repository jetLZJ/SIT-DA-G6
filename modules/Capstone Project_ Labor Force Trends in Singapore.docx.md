## **Capstone Project: " Analyzing Labor Force Trends in Singapore"**

In a **Data Analytics** environment, your task is to extract actionable insights from raw data. **Data exploration**, or **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, plays a critical role in this process. By examining the dataset's properties, utilizing statistical techniques, and employing data visualization, you will uncover hidden patterns and gain a comprehensive understanding of the data's characteristics. This initial stage is crucial for transforming raw data into a format that is ready for further analysis and decision-making.

An **intermediate step** involves **data modeling**, which enhances your analysis and predictive capabilities. **Machine learning** plays a crucial role here by allowing you to explore relationships between variables, make predictions, and gain deeper insights into the data. By using machine learning techniques like regression, classification, or clustering, you will be able to model complex patterns and forecast future trends, enabling more proactive decision-making.

**Interpretation** is a key aspect of Data Analytics. It bridges the gap between complex analytical outcomes and actionable insights. Your interpretations should be accessible to non-technical stakeholders, offering clear answers to the data analysis questions and guiding informed decision-making.

In summary, Data Exploration uncovers hidden patterns, Data Modeling enhances predictive analysis, and Machine Learning empowers data-driven decisions. Interpretation provides accessible insights that can be communicated to stakeholders. Together, these steps allow you to extract meaningful knowledge from raw data, make informed decisions, and help drive business success.

This **Capstone Project** requires you to explore and analyze the provided datasets to uncover meaningful insights. Your task is to identify hidden patterns, relationships, and trends that can provide valuable knowledge and drive informed decision-making. Through rigorous Data Exploration, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning, you will showcase your ability to extract actionable insights and demonstrate the application of the skills learned throughout the course.

#### **Project Overview:**

In this capstone project, you will focus on analyzing the trends in unemployment and employment across industries in Singapore, using the **Unemployment Trend dataset**. The dataset contains critical information related to the labor force, including unemployment rates, the number of employed individuals, industry-specific data, and demographic insights. 

---

### **Capstone Project Instructions:**

#### **1\. Define Your Objectives:**

You are the driver of this project. Start by defining your own research questions based on the datasets provided.

Think about areas that interest you or might be critical to businesses or policymakers, such as:

* What is the unemployment rate across different sectors in Singapore in 2024?

* Which industries are experiencing the highest and lowest growth in employment?

* What are the regional differences in unemployment, and which areas of Singapore are most affected?

* How do demographic factors (age, education level) correlate with employment rates across industries?

Focus on addressing at least two of these questions using the dataset.You should aim to explore all five modules of the course through your analysis. Be sure to define your objectives clearly at the beginning of the project.

### **Module 1: Data Fundamentals & SQL**

**Objective**: Use SQL to explore the dataset and understand its structure.

**Tasks**:

1. **Load the Data into SQL**: Import the Data Set a relational database.

2. **SQL Queries**:   
   * Write SQL queries to explore the dataset **based on your objectives**, identify trends, and examine relationships within the data.  
   * Import the dataset into a SQL-based system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) and create a relational database to organize the data.  
   * Focus on key tables or data categories such as industry employment statistics, unemployment rates, and demographic data.  
   * Join different tables to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Example queries:**

   * Identify which sectors have the highest unemployment rate.  
   * Look at the growth or decline in the workforce for different sectors.  
   * This can help to explore demographic correlations.

### **Module 2: Python for Data Cleaning & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

**Objective**: Clean the dataset and perform EDA using Python.

**Tasks**:

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   * Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant rows , restructuring columns for clarity, and transforming the data into an analysis-ready format.  
   * Handle missing values, duplicates, and ensure consistent formats for variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   * Use Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib** to conduct exploratory data analysis.  
   * Visualize trends such as changes in unemployment over time, regional variations, and industry-specific employment patterns.

3. **Example tasks:**

   * Visualize the unemployment rate over time for different industries (e.g., using line graphs).  
   * Create a bar chart showing the employment growth across different sectors.  
   * Use scatter plots or box plots to understand the relationship between education levels and unemployment rates.

---

### **Module 3: Statistics & Visualization**

**Objective**: Use statistical analysis and create compelling visualizations.

**Tasks**:

1. **Statistical Analysis**:

   * Perform statistical analysis using **pandas** and **SciPy** to calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode) for unemployment and employment data.  
   * Calculate correlations between variables .

2. **Visualization**:

   * Use **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to create compelling visualizations, including heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots.

3. **Example tasks**:

   * Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between unemployment and industry types.  
   * Create bar charts to compare employment rates across regions in Singapore.  
   * Use line graphs to show trends over time, such as changes in unemployment or employment growth.

### **Module 4: Machine Learning**

**Objective**: Apply machine learning techniques to predict trends or answer key questions.

**Tasks**:

1. **Machine Learning Models**:

   * Use machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the dataset.  
   * Choose any target variable to predict

2. **Feature Engineering**:

   * Extract new features (e.g., demographic indicators or regional factors) that may improve model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation**:

   * Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, or R-squared.

4. **Example tasks:**

   * Build a linear regression model to predict employment growth based on past data.
