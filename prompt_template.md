#### To-Do
- Produce code as define with the breakdown below
- Get the requirements / arguments from appendix section for each segment

#### Code Style Breakdown
- Imports / Libraries
- Declaration / init
- Functions
- main

#### Notes:
- Assume the role of a senior data engineer / analyst
- Always includes validation for arguments
- Always catch errors and do error handling
- refrain from code duplications
- Prefer one-liner if possible
- create test-cases to test functions
- use minimum external libraries as much as  possible
- functions generated should be concise and do only 1 responibility at a time
- Take consideration to Big O notation for performance purpose
- libraries used must not be deprecated
- create folders for files structuring
- md documentation should include the functions / application description as well
- for applications, always provides an exit execution


#### Appendix


- Language : python

- Requirements : Create a data analytics with data narrative streamlit app for presentation derived from the following requirements
    - Read into the module folder
    - Read the problem statement to understand the problem statement
    - Requirements for the presentation can be found in the capstone project document
    - The components have been partially complete (broke down by modules, naming M1 to M4, and the components can be identify from the file name in this folde)
    - With what have been done, combine them and setup a streamlit app, encompassing all the components that have been done.

- Libraries : prefably plotly with animation for graph plot. There is a need to import powerBI into the streamlit app as well so will require libraries for that.

- Functions : what you seem fit

- Additionals :
    - You may refer to https://storytellingwithdata.streamlit.app/ as the layout of the streamlit app, but give the app a more professional look.
    - The narrative between modules should be fluid
    - update the main README.md describing the app and the narrative of the problem statement. Also show instruction how to start the app. And include credits and reference.

#### Requirements stated are final and no follow up is required. You are allow to think and enhance for the requirements.
