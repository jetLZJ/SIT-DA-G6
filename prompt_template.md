#### To-Do
- Produce code as define with the breakdown below
- Get the requirements / arguments from appendix section for each segment

#### Code Style Breakdown
- Imports / Libraries
- Declaration / init
- Functions
- main

#### Notes:
- Assume the role of a senior data engineer / analyst
- Visual should be as professional as possible
- functions generated should be concise and do only 1 responibility at a time
- Take consideration to Big O notation for performance purpose
- libraries used must not be deprecated
- md documentation should include the functions / application description as well
- for applications, always provides an exit execution


#### Appendix


- Language : python

- Requirements : Create a data analytics with data narrative streamlit app for presentation derived from the following requirements
    - Read into the module folder
    - Read the problem statement to understand the problem statement
    - Requirements for the presentation can be found in the capstone project document
    - The components have been partially complete (broke down by modules, naming M1 to M4, and the components can be identify from the file name in this folder). examine the compleed modules and design how to add them into the streamlit app for data narrative presentation

- Libraries : There is a need to import powerBI into the streamlit app as well so will require libraries for that.

- Functions : what you seem fit

- Additionals :
    - You may refer to https://storytellingwithdata.streamlit.app/ as the layout of the streamlit app, but give the app a more professional look.
    - The narrative between modules should be fluid
    - update the main README.md describing the app and the narrative of the problem statement. Also show instruction how to start the app. And include credits and reference.
    - do not create new database if required. the mysql connection string can be found in the streamlit secrets.
    - The presentation should have 5 modules (with M2 and M3 1 section). 

#### Requirements stated are final and no follow up is required. You are allow to think and enhance for the requirements.
